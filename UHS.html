                <li><strong>Postural Screenings:</strong> Musculoskeletal and neurological assessments are offered each Fall semester for freshmen. Students meet with a clinician from MedSport who checks for postural alignment, range of motion and runs tests as applicable to the motions students are expected to practice as part of their degree program. Following the screening students receive an individualized home exercise program to address any weaknesses or imbalances. Screenings are also available for students during their sophomore and junior year. <a href = "https://smtdwellnessprogram.as.me/schedule/38cb0841"><strong> Register for an appointment here!</strong></a> </li>
                <li><strong>Performing Arts Health Clinic</strong> The on-site Performing Arts Health Clinic, offered in partnership with MedSport and MPerform, provides students, faculty, and staff, the opportunity to meet with either a MedSport clinician (Kristen Schuyten, PT, DPT) or a hand specialist (Lexie Muir-Pappas, OT, CHT) to discuss any pain, injury, or discomfort. These one-on-one appointments help students with identifying sources of pain and any postural misalignments. Participants are given individualized exercise and stretching plans. Referrals for further treatment are provided on an as-needed basis. Postural screenings are also available for appointments with Kristen Schuyten.<a href = "https://smtdwellnessprogram.as.me/schedule/38cb0841"><strong> Register for an appointment here!</strong></a></li>
